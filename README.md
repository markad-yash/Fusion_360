# POINTS 

- Every single physical object or things are in this world are in 3D shape and we use 2D representation for basic visulization in books.

- Basically we call 3D object as: ```An object is 3D if it is has three dimensions: length, breadth and height.```

- We are using 3D sofware [FUSION 360](https://github.com/markad-yash/Fusion_360/edit/main/README.md) for creating or making our imagination in real world or giving shape to our ideas. This is the best way to represent our idea/Imagination.



## WE ARE LEARNING TOGETHER STEP BY STEP

# WE WILL BE MAKING A CUP

## STEP 1 :

```CREATING SKETCH```

 - For any type of object you need to basically understand what is base of hole object and project 2D sketch 
 > IN THE FIRST STEP GO TO CREATE SKETCH SECTION AS SHOWN IN IMAGE

![02 SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58439868/132986767-07cd2143-e087-4d68-9697-6d8965843cff.png)


## STEP 2 :
```CREATING CIRCLE IN SKETCH```

- Now you are in 2D sketch environment.

- Here you can create any 2d valid sketch for your 3D model.

- We are creating circle of ```100 unit``` for base of our 3D cup.

- SKECTH OF CIRCLE IS SHOWN IN BELOW WINDOW

## STEP 3 :
 ```FINISHING CIRCLE SKETCH```
 
 - Here we completed our one task for next main task.

- Below figure shows how windows look after completing sketch, basically we are in 3D workspace.

- Now we need cylindrical shape by ```EXTRUDING``` the hole circle by some unit height.

- By selecting the ```EXTRUDE``` option from tool we can convert 2D circle in 3D shape cylinder.

## STEP 4 :

```CREAING CYLINDER FROM 2D SKETCH```

- Here you can see that the GREY color cylinder kind of look like 3D object.

- We are giving roughly height of ```150 unit ``` to our cylinder.

- This is moment of truth we did the most hard part and that is too easy for us .....!

- See the cylinder in below image
